# mulab-info

Lab Î¼ infomation management system based on ldap

## development

0. Install a ldap server, for example osixia/openldap .

0. Set proper environment variables. You can write them in secret.env which has been ignored by .gitignore.

0. Run `npm install --no-optional` to install dependencies. Option `--no-optional` is required since one of bunyan's optional dependency will produce error, which prevent debugging.

0. Run `gulp` for compiling.

0. Run `node dist/index.js` and the server is listening at `127.0.0.1:3000`.
